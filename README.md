The قلب Programming Language
===========================
‫قلب‬ is a simple, [Scheme-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_language) programming language that you code entirely in [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic). It is an exploration of the impact of human culture on computer science, the role of tradition in software engineering, and the connection between natural and computer languages.

Syntax
------
‫قلب‬ has a minimal Scheme-like parenthesized syntax.

Hello world looks like this

```scheme
‫(قول "مرحبا يا عالم!")
```


Name
----
قلب is pronounced 'alb and means "heart" in Arabic. It is a recursive acronym standing for قلب: لغة برمجة, pronounced 'alb: lughat barmajeh, meaning "'alb: a programming language."
